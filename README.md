# PyBer_Analysis
Bootcamo Module 5 - Pyber

## Overview
We have the need to analyze the data that was given to us by city type. As we can see in the Data, we have 3 types of cities:
- Urban
- Suburban
- Rural
The main goal of the Analysis is to explore the difference between the fares of these city types, explore the disparity and find the root of the issue. In order to analyze the data we will create a multi-line chart that compares the total fares of the 3 city types through the course of time.

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
First of all, lets analyze the data from the first deliverable (chart bellow). In this chart we can see the 3 city types, the total drivers, the total fares, the average fare per ride and the average fer per rider.

As we can observe, urban cities have the most rides (1,625) and drivers (2,405), which is not surprising. Naturally, suburban cities follow in second place, having 625 rides and 490 drivers. Lastly, we have rural cities, which are the city type with the least amount of rides (125) drivers (78). Surprisingly, in the urban cities, we have more rides than cities, which practically mean, that not all drivers are getting rides. In suburban cities we have a positive ratio of drivers and rides. Finally in rural cities we also have a bigger rides to driver ratio. Also we can see that urban cities have the lowest average per fare ($24.53) and lowest average fare per rider ($16.67). Suburban cities are a little better off ($30.97 average fare per ride and $39.50 average fare per rider) and rural cities have the highest average of fare per ride($34.62) and highest average fare per driver ($54.49). We can see in the chart bellow, that tendency is true through all the time we analyzed the data.

## Summary
Based on the data analyzed and in the outputs of the analysis, my recommendations are the following:
- We have to many drivers in urban cities. I would recommend to lower the amount of drivers in urban areas to lower the supply of drivers, while the demand will be the same. This will impact both, the drivers and PyBer, into higher fares and more profitable rides.
- I also recommend that we move some urban drivers to suburban and rural cities. We can see we have more drivers than rides in urban cities, which means that not all drivers are getting rides in ubran cities, however this is untrue for suburban and rural cities, where we have many more rides than drivers.
- I would also recommend and expansion into more suburban and rural cities. In these cities we have higher averages for fares per driver and fares per ride, which makes this city types more profitable for PyBer.
